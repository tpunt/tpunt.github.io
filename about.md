My name is Tom (online alias: **tpunt**) and I am a 21 year old programmer from the UK. I am currently in
my final year at the University of Portsmouth studying for a BSc (Hons) in Web
Technologies. I have a vehement interest in programming, with particular focus
on server-side web development technologies.

I typically use PHP and Elixir (with Phoenix) to satisfy my web development
needs, and so those are the technologies I'll mostly be blogging about here.
